# MDF-FBMN
As a visual compound identification technology, MN has been widely used to discover unknown components in natural products. The principle of feature-based molecular networking (FBMN) is to cluster the MS/MS spectra of different precursor ions based on their similarity to identify unknown compounds . However, these methods need to process cumbersome raw data when used alone or in combination.
This study established a python code-based tool for mass defect filtering combined with nitrogen rule filtering.The processed data can be uploaded to the GNPS platform for feature-based molecular network analysis.This method only requires simple input of the feature quantification table (Raw.csv) aligned by Progenesis QI software, the MS/MS spectral summary (Raw.msp) file, and the file used to construct the MDF (MDF_NRF_Window.xlsx).It should be noted that when processing MDF data, the first two rows in the raw data (Raw.csv) need to be deleted, and when uploading to GNPS, the deleted rows need to be added to the output file (match_result.csv).The MDF file (MDF_NRF_Window.xlsx) describes in detail what needs to be entered in each column, and you can refer to the example file (MDF_NRF_Window-Example.xlsx).In order to give users a better editing experience, we provide an exe file, the specific link is as follows.
